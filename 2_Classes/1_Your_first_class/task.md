# Your first class

You can define a class with the *class* keyword followed by the
camelcased name of the class.
Keep in mind to close the class definition with the *end* keyword, e.g.:

`class ClassName`
`end`

Camelcasing the class name is not necessary, but is a naming convention in Ruby.

---

Define a class *Programmer* similar to the example above!
