## Ruby is...

`  " A dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on`
`    simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that`
`    is natural to read and easy to write. "`

as the official Ruby page (https://www.ruby-lang.org) describes it.

It was designed and built in the mid-90s by *Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto* in Japan.

Ruby is a cross platform interpreted language with a dynamic type system and
automatic memory management. Its development was inspired by multiple other
programming languages, such as Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp.

There are several different implementations of Ruby.
The *MRI* (Matz Ruby Implementation) or *CRuby* is the reference implementation.
Other implementations are *JRuby*, *Rubinius*, *MacRuby*, *mruby*, *IronRuby*,...

Ruby is often used to build web applications, due to the mature *Ruby on Rails*
and *Sinatra* frameworks. Nevertheless it can be applied to all kinds of use
cases, from prototyping, to scientific computation, to command line interfaces
and desktop apps (Daigaku is also fully written in Ruby :) ).

## Naming Ruby files

Source code files for Ruby have a `.rb` extension and are usually named with
lowercase words, which are - if necessary - joined by an underscore:

e.g. `student.rb`, `multiple_words.rb`, `even_more_words.rb`.

## The interactive Ruby console

If you open a new tab in your terminal and enter `irb`, you will start the
*interactive Ruby* console. The irb is a useful tool for rapidly trying out
ruby code. You can quit the irb again by entering `exit`. Give it a try!
