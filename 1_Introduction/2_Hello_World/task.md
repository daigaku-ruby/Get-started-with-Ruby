# Say Hello World in Ruby

In Ruby you can print to the standard output by using the *print* method.
If you want to print a new line you can use the *puts* (or the shorter *p*)
method.

*print* and *puts* take one or multiple comma-separated objects as parameter
and turns them into a String before printing to the the standard output
*$stdout*.

`print 'a'` just prints out *a*.
`print 'a', 'b', 'c'` prints out *abc*.

The two *''* declare a Ruby String object. You can also use *""* to create a
String. We will discuss the difference of *''* and *""* later on.

## For now, let's do the Hello World example in Ruby:

-----

Print out *Hello* *World* to the standard output!
